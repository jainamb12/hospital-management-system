# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This Hospital Management System is a console-based Java application developed as a first-semester project. It demonstrates fundamental Java concepts like conditional statements, loops, and functions, alongside core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system utilizes an array of objects to efficiently store and manage patient data, and it's designed for use by hospital administrative staff.

## Features

This system provides the following functionalities for hospital administration:

2. **Patient Registration**: Register new patients, capturing essential details such as ID, name, age, date, day, and contact information.
3. **Patient Update**: Modify details for existing patient records.
4. **Appointment Booking**: Schedule appointments for patients with doctors, considering doctor availability on specific days.
